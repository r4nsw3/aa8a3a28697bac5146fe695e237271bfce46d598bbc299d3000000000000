  |   Complete the mission... or face erasure. That's all Neku knows        |
  |   after regaining consciousness in the middle of a busy intersection    |
  |   without his memories. Now he and his partner must fight to survive    |
  |   a life-or-death game in this twisted tale with more turns than the    |
  |   urban labyrinth of Tokyo they're trapped in. This definitive          |
  |   version of Square Enix's RPG classic brings the dark story to life    |
  |   on the Nintendo Switch system along with an extra chapter,            |
  |   exclusive two-player combat, and some killer, new remixed music.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In the crowded chaos of Tokyo, players of the Reapers' Game must      |
  |   complete daily missions or face total erasure. Neku might not be      |
  |   enthusiastic about forging relationships, but with his very life on   |
  |   the line, he'll need to learn how to work together with a             |
  |   partner-and fast: they only have seven days. Gear up with             |
  |   stat-enhancing threads and collect mysterious pins to unleash         |
  |   psychic abilities in battle. Take control of real-time,               |
  |   action-fueled RPG battles using touch controls or Joy-Con             |
  |   controllers. With new features in addition to all the content from    |
  |   the Nintendo DS and mobile versions, the definitive version of this   |
  |   modern classic is finally here.                                       |
